# Development

clone the repository with

`git clone git@github.com:axsk/ISOKANN.jl.git`

and create your own branch with

`git checkout -b mynewcoolbranch`.

Install julia, preferrably with `juliaup` (at least version 1.9).
We recommend `using Revise` for a smoother dev experience.

Dont forget to activate the project with `]activate .`
and instantiate the dependencies with `]instantiate`.
You should then be able to run the tests with `]test`
or start `using ISOKANN`.
