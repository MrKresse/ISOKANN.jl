1. Unification of isomolly/isosimple:

- implement dataloaders
 - static (Flux.DataLoader)
    - batch
    - rng
    - subsampling
 - stationary
 - adaptive

2. Visualization of the validation loss

3. Find a way to compare performances between different architectures, optimizers and adaptive samplings.
- of special interest: how does adaptive sampling compare to ergodic samples on a low temp alanine-dipept.
